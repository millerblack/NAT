This TestFramework works togther with WRS (Crosswalk Test Report Center),
and PS (Packages Server) is plus.

===Object===
This TestFramework is aimed to test those test-suites
(https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-test-suite) for Crosswalk
automatically.

===
The files tests_list_embedded.spec & tests_list_shareded.spec under the 'Device_Name' should be the same for all branches, that's,for example, the file tests_list_embedded.spec for canary is the same as tests_list_embedded.spec for beta (or stable).
